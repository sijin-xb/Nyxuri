// Cover-art state for the dashboard's media page: which artwork to show, and
// the palette derived from it.
//
// Ported from end4-pC's modules/ii/settings/DashboardMediaState.qml. In end4-pC
// this is what makes the media page stop looking like the settings panel and
// start looking like the record that is playing — the whole surface, toolbar
// and controls take the cover's colour while a track is on.
//
// Difference from end4-pC: it downloads remote covers itself with a curl
// Process and caches under Directories.coverArt, then quantises with a
// ColorQuantizer. nyxuri already has that entire pipeline behind MediaPalette
// (native Oklab binning plus a python fetch script, see
// app/services/…/fetch_cover.py), so this object is only the adapter: it picks
// the active player, hands the art URL to MediaPalette, and exposes the result
// in the shape the dashboard reads.
